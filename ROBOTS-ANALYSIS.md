# Robots Analysis for the Daily Pennsylvanian

The Daily Pennsylvanian's `robots.txt` file is available at
[https://www.thedp.com/robots.txt](https://www.thedp.com/robots.txt).

## Contents of the `robots.txt` file on May 2, 2025

```
User-agent: *
Crawl-delay: 10
Allow: /

User-agent: SemrushBot
Disallow: /
```

## Explanation

The robots.txt file from The Daily Pennsylvanian contains two directive sections:

1. **General directives (applies to all user agents):**
   - `User-agent: *` - This line indicates that the following rules apply to all web crawlers/robots.
   - `Crawl-delay: 10` - This specifies that crawlers should wait at least 10 seconds between consecutive requests to the server. This prevents overwhelming the server with too many requests in a short period.
   - `Allow: /` - This explicitly permits crawlers to access all parts of the website. The forward slash represents the root directory, effectively allowing access to the entire site.

2. **SemrushBot-specific directives:**
   - `User-agent: SemrushBot` - This line specifies that the following rules apply specifically to the SemrushBot crawler (used by the SEO tool Semrush).
   - `Disallow: /` - This instructs SemrushBot specifically to not crawl any part of the website.

**Implications for our scraping project:**

Our web scraping activities are permitted under these guidelines as long as:
1. We are not using SemrushBot (which is explicitly disallowed)
2. We respect the 10-second crawl delay between requests
3. We limit our scraping to once per day as planned, which is well within the crawl-delay requirements

The robots.txt file explicitly allows crawling of the entire website for all other user agents, which includes our scraper. This confirms that we can ethically proceed with scraping the front page headlines while respecting the specified crawl delay.
